### Voice Protection Notes
FPR content follows a "preserve-first" editing approach. The institutional voice uses signature vocabulary that should never be flattened into generic synonyms. See the Voice Protection Playbook for the full do-not-flatten vocabulary list and paragraph architecture rules.

### Citation Style
- Numbered footnotes for in-text citations
- APA reference style in the footnote
- No full reference list (policy institute style)
- Goal: decision-maker credibility + readability

### Language
- Primary: English
- Secondary: Spanish (documents are often bilingual)
- FPR maintains a comprehensive English-to-Spanish style guide for translation consistency

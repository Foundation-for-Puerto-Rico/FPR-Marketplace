# Voice Constant, Tone Flexes

The core mental model for brand voice enforcement: voice is constant, tone flexes by context.

## The Distinction

**Voice** is WHO Foundation for Puerto Rico is — personality, values, identity. It never changes regardless of channel, audience, or content type. Think of it as FPR's character.

**Tone** is HOW FPR speaks in a given moment — formality, energy, technical depth. It adapts to context the way a person adjusts their tone when speaking to a community member vs. a federal funder vs. a municipal government official.

## Voice Constants: "We Are / We Are Not"

The "We Are / We Are Not" table is the anchor of FPR's brand voice. It defines FPR's personality in paired attributes — what the organization IS and the boundary it should never cross.

### FPR Voice Identity

| We Are | We Are Not |
|--------|------------|
| **Authoritative but accessible** — professional, strategic, solutions-driven; engaging for non-technical readers | **Academic or bureaucratic** — we never write in opaque government-speak or ivory-tower prose that excludes the public |
| **Visionary but anchored in evidence** — future-oriented, grounded in data, precedents, and institutional frameworks | **Dreamy or abstract** — vision without evidence is aspiration; every forward-looking claim links to data or a concrete model |
| **Asset-based** — we name problems as structural gaps, fragmentation, and capacity limits | **Deficit-based** — we never frame communities as "the problem"; disparities are attributed to structural conditions, not people |
| **Multisector and systems-oriented** — we connect sectors, territories, and actors into a coordinated model | **Siloed or programmatic** — we don't reduce systemic transformation to individual programs or linear "project" talk |
| **Propositive** — we move from diagnosis to action; clear "what we're proposing" and why it matters | **Merely diagnostic** — identifying problems without proposing solutions is incomplete; every analysis leads to a model or action |
| **Built for long-term transformation** — models, platforms, and scaffolding that endure beyond political cycles | **Short-term or project-bound** — we don't frame work as temporary interventions; we build enduring institutional infrastructure |
| **Bold and courageous** — we challenge the status quo and take positions that advance systemic change | **Reckless or confrontational** — boldness is constructive; we propose alternatives, not attacks |

### How to Use During Enforcement

For every piece of FPR content:
1. Check each "We Are" attribute — does the content reflect this?
2. Check each "We Are Not" boundary — does the content avoid crossing it?
3. If a boundary is crossed, revise the specific passage
4. If an attribute is missing, find a natural place to express it

Prioritize the 2-3 most relevant attributes for the content type and audience. Not every attribute needs to appear in every piece of content, but the **asset-based** and **propositive** attributes should almost always be present.

### FPR Paragraph Architecture (The "FPR Move")

FPR writing follows a signature paragraph logic that carries the institutional voice. Preserve this backbone even when tightening:

**Context/diagnosis → challenges/gaps/fragmentation → assets/opportunities → proposal/model → expected results/transformation**

Editorial rule: You can reorder slightly for clarity, but never delete steps that carry the narrative — especially "assets/opportunities" and "proposal." Removing these beats flattens FPR's voice into generic policy writing.

### Equity Framing Rules (Non-Negotiable)

**Do:**
- Attribute disparities to structural challenges, historic investment patterns, unequal access, structural conditions
- Use people-centered terms: residents, communities, families, youth, workforce

**Don't:**
- Use stigmatizing labels (e.g., "the poor") or any framing where communities are "the problem"
- Frame communities as passive recipients; they are active partners in transformation

### Stakeholder Universe Formula

Use this exact multisector formula when naming participants:
> "municipal governments, nonprofit organizations, public agencies, private sector actors, community stakeholders, and residents"

This consistency is a major voice-protection mechanism. Adapt the order for emphasis when needed, but include the full universe.

## Tone Flexes: The Three Dimensions

Tone adjusts along three independent dimensions:

### 1. Formality
How formal or institutional the language is.

| Level | Signals | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| High | Complete sentences, institutional terminology, structured format, third-person voice | Federal proposals, HUD reports, pillar briefs, policy documents |
| Medium | Clear and professional but conversational, light clarifiers on first use of key terms | Presentations, stakeholder communications, blog posts, newsletters |
| Low | Accessible language, shorter sentences, "we" voice | Social media, community-facing materials, internal communications |

### 2. Energy
How much urgency, vision, or dynamism the content conveys.

| Level | Signals | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| High | Active verbs, forward-looking language, transformation-oriented | Calls to action, campaign launches, social media, press releases |
| Medium | Steady pace, balanced between informative and visionary | Reports, pillar briefs, presentations, stakeholder communications |
| Warm | Empathetic, community-centered, supportive | Community-facing content, resident engagement, post-disaster communications |
| Low | Measured, deliberate, evidence-first | Legal/regulatory documents, compliance reports, technical analyses |

### 3. Technical Depth
How much policy, planning, or institutional detail is included.

| Level | Signals | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| High | Policy frameworks, legal citations, budget detail, methodology | Federal proposals, HUD deliverables, governance frameworks, impact reports |
| Medium | Key terms explained on first use, models described clearly | Pillar briefs, stakeholder presentations, public-facing reports |
| Low | Outcome-focused, vision-forward, no jargon | Social media, press releases, community newsletters, general public materials |

## Tone-by-Context Matrix

Combine the three dimensions for each FPR content type:

| Context | Formality | Energy | Technical Depth | Key Principle |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Federal proposal / HUD deliverable | High | Medium | High | Precision, evidence, institutional credibility |
| Pillar brief / strategy document | High | Medium | Medium-High | Vision anchored in data; the "FPR move" in full |
| Regional plan / community plan | Medium-High | Medium | Medium-High | Systems thinking accessible to mixed audiences |
| Press release / public announcement | Medium | High | Low | Bold vision, clear impact, accessible language |
| Social media post | Low-Medium | High | Low | Brevity, personality, call to action |
| Community newsletter / resident comms | Medium | Warm | Low-Medium | Empathy, clarity, asset-based framing |
| Stakeholder presentation | Medium-High | Medium-High | Medium | Show, don't just describe; lead with transformation |
| Funder correspondence / progress report | High | Medium | Medium-High | Results, milestones, institutional voice |
| Internal comms | Low | Medium | Varies | Authentic, less polished, but values still present |

## Applying Voice + Tone Together

**Example: Federal proposal (HUD/FEMA)**

Voice constants active:
- **Authoritative but accessible** — institutional credibility without bureaucratic opacity
- **Visionary but anchored in evidence** — every claim ties to data, precedent, or framework
- **Built for long-term transformation** — emphasize enduring models, not one-off projects

Tone settings:
- Formality: High (third-person institutional voice, structured format)
- Energy: Medium (measured confidence, evidence-driven urgency)
- Technical Depth: High (policy frameworks, budgets, methodology)

**Example: Social media post**

Voice constants active:
- **Bold and courageous** — take a clear position
- **Asset-based** — highlight community strengths and opportunities
- **Propositive** — point toward action, not just awareness

Tone settings:
- Formality: Low-Medium (conversational but professional)
- Energy: High (active verbs, urgency, vision)
- Technical Depth: Low (outcomes and impact, not methodology)

**Example: Community newsletter**

Voice constants active:
- **Asset-based** — lead with community strengths and achievements
- **Propositive** — make next steps clear and inviting
- **Accessible** — no jargon, people-centered language

Tone settings:
- Formality: Medium (clear, warm, professional)
- Energy: Warm (empathetic, supportive, community-centered)
- Technical Depth: Low-Medium (explain concepts simply, use examples)

## Common Enforcement Mistakes for FPR Content

1. **Flattening institutional language into generic corporate speak** — FPR's signature vocabulary ("framework for transformation," "shared stewardship," "thriving future") is identity, not wordiness. Protect it.
2. **Deleting the values layer** — Stewardship, shared prosperity, and community benefit aren't decoration. They carry the institutional voice.
3. **Removing the "assets/opportunities" beat** from paragraph architecture — This is the move that distinguishes FPR from deficit-based policy writing.
4. **Over-simplifying systems language into "program" talk** — FPR builds models, platforms, and scaffolding. Don't reduce to "programs" or "initiatives."
5. **Confusing voice with tone** — If the user asks for "casual" content, adjust TONE (lower formality, higher energy). Don't change VOICE (FPR's identity stays the same).
6. **Swapping signature terms for generic synonyms** — "thriving future" ≠ "positive outcomes"; "living roadmap" ≠ "strategic plan"; "shared stewardship" ≠ "collaboration."

## Do-Not-Flatten Vocabulary

These words and phrases are doing real institutional work in FPR's narrative. Protect them even when tightening:

**Core manifesto phrases:**
- "framework for transformation"
- "living roadmap"
- "thriving future"
- "rooted in sustainability, resilience and shared prosperity"
- "shared stewardship"
- "inclusive community engagement"
- "collective responsibility"
- "asset-based development"
- "sustainable destination management"

**Governance + institution-building:**
- "permanent, independent, multisectoral, decision-making body"
- "enduring institutional anchor"
- "institutional backbone"
- "braided funding"
- "community roundtables / advisory committees"

**Visitor economy framing:**
- "visitor economy becomes a strategic lever"
- "tourism enhances — not burdens — local communities"
- "attractions not as commodities… foundation of a sustainable economy"

**Mobility + technology:**
- "integrated, technologically advanced, multimodal"
- "Mobility as a Service (MaaS)… digital backbone"

**Human capital:**
- "treat human capital as a form of public infrastructure"
- "people at the heart of development… shared prosperity"

# Before/After Content Examples

Concrete examples showing how FPR brand voice enforcement transforms generic content into on-brand output. Each example shows the generic version, the enforced version, and annotations explaining what changed and why.

These examples are drawn from Foundation for Puerto Rico's actual content types: federal proposals, pillar briefs, public communications, community engagement materials, and funder correspondence.

## Federal Proposal Executive Summary (HUD/FEMA)

### Before (Generic)
```
We are pleased to submit this proposal for the community resilience program.
Our organization has experience working with communities in Puerto Rico to
help them recover from natural disasters. We believe our approach can improve
outcomes for vulnerable populations and create better conditions for residents.
```

### After (Brand Voice Enforced)
```
Puerto Rico's southern region faces a convergence of structural challenges:
fragmented governance across 14 municipalities, limited cross-sector coordination,
and infrastructure systems built for recovery rather than long-term resilience.
Yet the region holds significant assets — deep community networks, emerging
local leadership, and a visitor economy that generated $XX million in 2024.

This proposal outlines a regional governance framework that transforms these
assets into an enduring institutional backbone. The model establishes a
permanent, independent, multisectoral decision-making body connecting municipal
governments, nonprofit organizations, public agencies, private sector actors,
community stakeholders, and residents into a coordinated system designed to
endure beyond political cycles.
```

### What Changed
- **Voice: Authoritative but accessible** — opens with structural analysis, not "we are pleased"
- **Voice: Asset-based** — names challenges as structural, then pivots to community strengths
- **Voice: Propositive** — moves from diagnosis to a specific governance model
- **Voice: Built for long-term transformation** — "enduring institutional backbone," "beyond political cycles"
- **Paragraph architecture**: Context → challenges → assets → proposal (the FPR move)
- **Stakeholder formula**: Full multisector universe included
- **Tone: Formality HIGH** — third-person institutional voice, structured
- **Tone: Energy MEDIUM** — measured confidence, evidence-driven
- **Tone: Technical depth HIGH** — governance frameworks, institutional specifics

## Pillar Brief / Strategy Section

### Before (Generic)
```
Tourism is an important industry for the region. However, many communities
don't benefit from tourism revenue. We need to develop better tourism
programs that help local people and protect natural resources.
```

### After (Brand Voice Enforced)
```
The visitor economy represents a strategic lever for regional transformation
— not merely an industry to manage, but a platform through which economic
reinvestment, youth empowerment, and heritage preservation converge. Current
conditions reveal a structural gap: tourism activity generates significant
revenue, yet economic value leaks from communities rather than being
reintegrated locally.

The proposed sustainable destination management framework repositions
attractions not as commodities to be marketed but as the foundation of a
sustainable economy — one where tourism enhances, not burdens, local
communities. This model connects cultural, natural, and creative attractors
into an integrated system that channels visitor spending toward resident
benefit, workforce development, and environmental stewardship.
```

### What Changed
- **Voice: Visionary but anchored in evidence** — "strategic lever" with structural analysis, not vague "important industry"
- **Voice: Asset-based** — "cultural, natural, and creative attractors" instead of problems to fix
- **Voice: Systems-oriented** — connects tourism, economy, workforce, and environment as a system
- **Voice: NOT deficit-based** — communities aren't failing; structural gaps cause value leakage
- **Protected vocabulary**: "strategic lever," "sustainable destination management," "attractors," "enhances not burdens"
- **Paragraph architecture**: Context → gap → assets → model → outcomes
- **Tone: Formality HIGH** — policy-register, third-person
- **Tone: Energy MEDIUM** — visionary but measured
- **Tone: Technical depth MEDIUM-HIGH** — frameworks described, terms introduced with context

## Press Release / Public Announcement

### Before (Generic)
```
Foundation for Puerto Rico is excited to announce a new program to help
communities in the southern region. The program will provide resources
and support to help people recover and build a better future. We look
forward to working with our partners on this important initiative.
```

### After (Brand Voice Enforced)
```
Foundation for Puerto Rico today launched the Southern Region Resilience
Framework — a multisector governance model connecting 14 municipalities,
community organizations, and private sector partners into a coordinated
system for long-term regional transformation.

The framework moves beyond recovery toward a shared vision: a southern
Puerto Rico where communities direct their own development, economic value
stays local, and institutional capacity endures beyond any single
administration or funding cycle.

"This is not a program — it's a platform for how the region governs its
own future," said [Name], [Title] at Foundation for Puerto Rico.
```

### What Changed
- **Voice: Bold and courageous** — "not a program — it's a platform" takes a clear position
- **Voice: Propositive** — leads with the model, not the announcement
- **Voice: Built for long-term transformation** — "endures beyond any single administration"
- **Voice: NOT short-term** — explicitly distinguishes from "program" framing
- **Tone: Formality MEDIUM** — professional press register, clear and direct
- **Tone: Energy HIGH** — active verbs, forward-looking, transformation-oriented
- **Tone: Technical depth LOW** — accessible to general public, no jargon

## Social Media Post

### Before (Generic)
```
We're excited to share our new report on community resilience in Puerto Rico!
Check out the link below to learn about our work helping communities build
a better future. #PuertoRico #Resilience #Community
```

### After (Brand Voice Enforced)
```
14 municipalities. One coordinated vision.

Puerto Rico's southern region has the assets — deep community networks,
cultural heritage, a growing visitor economy. What it needs is the
institutional scaffolding to connect them.

Our new report shows how a regional governance framework can turn
fragmented recovery into lasting transformation.

```

### What Changed
- **Voice: Bold and courageous** — opens with a striking structural framing, not "we're excited"
- **Voice: Asset-based** — leads with what the region HAS, not what it lacks
- **Voice: Propositive** — points to the solution (governance framework), not just the problem
- **Protected vocabulary**: "institutional scaffolding," "lasting transformation"
- **Tone: Formality LOW-MEDIUM** — conversational but professional
- **Tone: Energy HIGH** — short punchy sentences, clear call to action
- **Tone: Technical depth LOW** — outcomes-focused, no policy jargon

## Community Newsletter / Resident Communication

### Before (Generic)
```
Dear Community Members,

We wanted to let you know about some new projects happening in your area.
Our organization is working to improve conditions and help your community
become more resilient. We will be holding meetings soon where you can
learn more and give your input.
```

### After (Brand Voice Enforced)
```
Dear Residents and Community Partners,

Your neighborhood has always been defined by its strengths — the networks
you've built, the knowledge you carry, the care you invest in this place.
The work ahead is about channeling those assets into a shared plan that
reflects your priorities and protects what matters most.

Over the coming weeks, we'll host community roundtables where you can
shape the vision directly. These aren't presentations — they're working
sessions where residents, local organizations, and municipal leaders
build the plan together.
```

### What Changed
- **Voice: Asset-based** — opens with community strengths, not organizational updates
- **Voice: Propositive** — clear next step (roundtables) with defined purpose
- **Voice: NOT deficit-based** — community is an active partner, not a passive recipient of help
- **Stakeholder framing**: "residents, local organizations, and municipal leaders" — people first
- **Equity framing**: People-centered terms, agency and ownership language
- **Tone: Formality MEDIUM** — warm but professional
- **Tone: Energy WARM** — empathetic, supportive, community-centered
- **Tone: Technical depth LOW-MEDIUM** — accessible, no jargon, concrete next steps

## Grant Progress Report / Funder Correspondence

### Before (Generic)
```
During this reporting period, we completed several activities as planned.
We held community meetings and made progress on our goals. The project
is on track and we anticipate meeting our milestones. We continue to
work with local partners to implement the program.
```

### After (Brand Voice Enforced)
```
During this reporting period, FPR advanced three structural milestones
within the regional governance framework:

1. Completed participatory needs assessments across 8 of 14 target
   municipalities, engaging 340+ residents, 22 nonprofit organizations,
   and 12 municipal government representatives.

2. Established the cross-sector coordinating body for the southern region,
   with memoranda of understanding from 6 municipalities and 4 anchor
   institutions.

3. Drafted the community resilience action plans for Guanica and Guayanilla,
   incorporating community roundtable input from 120+ resident participants.

These milestones reflect the model's design intent: building institutional
capacity that connects existing community assets to permanent governance
structures, rather than delivering services through parallel systems.
```

### What Changed
- **Voice: Authoritative but accessible** — specific metrics, clear structure, institutional voice
- **Voice: Visionary but anchored in evidence** — every claim has numbers and specifics
- **Voice: Systems-oriented** — frames milestones as parts of a governance model, not isolated activities
- **Voice: Built for long-term transformation** — closing line distinguishes from service-delivery framing
- **Stakeholder formula**: Residents, nonprofits, municipalities — full ecosystem
- **Tone: Formality HIGH** — third-person, structured, report register
- **Tone: Energy MEDIUM** — confident and precise, not breathless
- **Tone: Technical depth MEDIUM-HIGH** — specific enough for funders, not overloaded

## Using These Examples

When enforcing FPR's brand voice, reference the relevant content type example to calibrate:
1. Match the content type to the closest example above
2. Note which voice attributes are most active for that type
3. Apply the tone settings (formality, energy, technical depth)
4. Verify the FPR paragraph architecture is present (context → challenges → assets → proposal → results)
5. Check equity framing rules — no deficit framing, people-centered language
6. Verify protected vocabulary is preserved — don't flatten signature terms into generic synonyms
7. Confirm stakeholder universe formula is used when naming participants

non_negotiables:
  - id: NNQ-001
    rule: "NO CERTAINTY UPGRADES"
    description: >
      Do not increase degree of certainty. Preserve author's original modality
      (can, may, might, aims to, seeks to, helps, is intended to, etc.).
      Do NOT turn cautious language into guaranteed outcomes.
      If readability requires changes, keep the same modals and level of caution.
  - id: NNQ-002
    rule: "PRESERVE-FIRST LINE EDITING"
    description: >
      Default to minimal close-to-original edits. Recompose only for significant
      problems (meaning ambiguity, grammatical error, major public-reader friction,
      terminology inconsistency, or clarity break due to density).
      Escalation ladder: punctuation/connector tweaks → parallelism fix →
      split sentence → recompose (last resort, 70-80% original wording).
  - id: NNQ-003
    rule: "PROTECT FPR VOICE"
    description: >
      If change makes text shorter/cleaner but flattens FPR voice, reject it.
      After preserve-first edits, apply Master Editor Lens (second micro-pass)
      to remove friction without changing meaning, certainty, or voice.
  - id: NNQ-004
    rule: "EQUITY + FRAMING"
    description: >
      Asset-based framing. Attribute disparities to structural conditions.
      Do not stigmatize communities or imply communities are the problem.
  - id: NNQ-005
    rule: "SYSTEMS + GOVERNANCE INTEGRITY"
    description: >
      Maintain strong systems framing (regional coordination, multisector
      collaboration, durable models/platforms — not one-off programs).
      Do not remove values framing (stewardship, shared prosperity, community benefit).

  deep:
    description: >
      Reorganize within section for narrative logic, tighten redundancies,
      strengthen transitions/topic sentences, improve accessibility —
      without flattening FPR voice and without certainty upgrades.

safe_to_tighten:
  - "True redundancy with no new meaning"
  - "Unclear pronouns → replace with specific nouns"
  - "Overly academic clutter without flattening voice"
  - "Transitions, topic sentences, flow for public readability"

reject_always:
  - "Any edit that changes meaning, scope, or degree of certainty"
  - "Edits that genericize signature language into bland corporate prose"
  - "Edits that remove values framing or weaken governance/systems integrity"

structural_logic:
  preserve: "context/diagnosis → challenges/gaps → assets/opportunities → proposal/model → expected impact/transformation"
  rule: "Do not delete the 'assets/opportunity' or 'proposal/model' beat simply to shorten the text"

readability:
  jargon: "Reduce where possible; do not oversimplify concepts"
  first_use: "Add light clarifiers on first use of specialized terms (one clause, not a detour)"
  semicolons: "Max 1 per sentence in narrative sections"
  repetition: "Reduce accidental repetition by rotating phrasing — WITHOUT flattening voice or changing meaning"

punctuation:
  em_dash:
    rule: "Allowed but must earn their place. Use only when they add clear rhetorical value."
    allowed_uses:
      - "Pivot/contrast that should pop"
      - "Intentional cadence break"
      - "Compressed emphasis"
      - "To avoid ambiguity or awkward commas"
    not_allowed:
      - "Routine clarifiers (use parentheses)"
      - "Simple appositives (use commas)"
    clustering_rule: "After editing each chunk, if em dashes cluster, replace lowest-value ones with splits/colons/parentheses/commas"
  hyphens: "Only for true compounds (e.g., post-COVID, place-based)"

chunking:
  chunk_size: "600-1000 words (400-800 for lists/figures/definitions)"
  chunk_by: "One subsection or clean stop at a subheading"
  session_size: "6-10 chunks per chat session"
  figure_rule: "Include lead-in sentence + figure text + paragraph right after"

stakeholder_formula:
  standard: "municipal governments, nonprofit organizations, public agencies, private sector actors, community stakeholders, and residents"
  rule: "Use this exact formula when listing stakeholder groups"

readability_rules:

master_editor_lens:
  description: "Second micro-pass for elegance and cadence — only where it removes friction without changing meaning, certainty, or voice"
  allowed:
    - "Remove micro-repetition (same verb/phrase twice in a sentence/paragraph)"
    - "Swap a phrase for a cleaner equivalent that preserves tone and claim strength"
    - "Replace slightly clunky time/sequence constructions with plain, vivid phrasing"
    - "Tighten transitions only when they improve flow and don't delete narrative beats"

    - "Reader friction: public reader would need to re-read"
    - "Consistency risk: terminology conflicts with locked rules"
    - "Excessive density: sentence too long for clarity"
  escalation_ladder:
    1: "Fix punctuation and small connector words"
